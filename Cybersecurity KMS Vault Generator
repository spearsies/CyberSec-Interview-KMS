# Python script to automatically generate the Obsidian vault structure based on the architectural plan. This implementation establishes a two-level "controlled hierarchy" to minimize cognitive load [1] and includes pre-configured templates for atomic notes, interview preparation, and technical laboratories.[2, 3]
The vault is organized into the following key zones:
10 - MOCs (Maps of Content): Centralized indices to navigate broad domains like Cloud Security or Networking.
20 - Key Concepts: Atomic technical notes with standardized metadata for encryption and protocol security.[2, 4]
30 - Interviews: A repository for STAR-method responses and technical Q&A, including networking fundamentals and cloud-native security.
99 - Meta: A storage area for templates and automation scripts, such as MITRE ATT&CK parsers.

# Describe the TCP 3-Way Handshake

## Sample Response
The TCP 3-way handshake is the process used to establish a reliable connection. It consists of:
1. **SYN**: Client sends a synchronize packet to the server.
2. **SYN-ACK**: Server responds with a synchronize-acknowledgment.
3. **ACK**: Client sends an acknowledgment back.

## Interview Tip
Discuss connection-oriented communication and how it differs from UDP.[5]

| 7 | Application | WAF, SQLi Prevention |
| 4 | Transport | TLS/SSL |
| 3 | Network | IPsec, Firewalls |
| 2 | Data Link | ARP Security |

## Key Notes
Understanding the OSI model is essential for mapping where specific vulnerabilities occur.[6, 5]

## Password Entropy
Entropy ($E$) is calculated using the length ($L$) and character set range ($R$):

## Risk Assessment
General risk calculation:
$$Risk = Likelihood \times Impact$$ [6]
